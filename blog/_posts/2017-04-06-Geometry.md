### Lie Groups for 2d and 3d Transformation

> A **Manifold** is an n-Dimensional Topological Space that is locally Euclidean.


A Lie group is a topological group that is also a smooth manifold. Each of them is associated with a Lie algebra which is a vector space. Transformations are required to be **composed, inverted, differentiated and interpolated**. Lie groups and their associated machinery address all these operations in a pricipled way.
