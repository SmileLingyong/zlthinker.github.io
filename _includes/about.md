# About
I'm a third-year PhD candidate in Deparment of Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST. I am now undertaking research on 3D reconstruction, structure-from-motion, image retrieval under esteemed tutelage of [Prof. Long Quan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~quan/). Previously, I achieved bachelor's degree at College of Information Science & Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University. My CV can be accessed [here](./files/cv.pdf).
